# Maze Runner 2D

Originally created as a birthday game surprise for a friend, this small game has evolved into a quirky little Python project off mine. You play as a character trying to escape a pursuing monster across procedurally generated maps. Watch out for trees(or cacti, or rocks), grab shields and fruits, and stay alive!

Built with Python and Turtle graphics

Procedural map generation with 3 biomes

Simple AI behavior (chaser)

One-off power-ups per map

Randomized obstacles

Clean code + assets included
